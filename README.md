# PUSH
Simple but interesting Windows terminal game.

WASD to move your character around. ESC to shutdown and BACKSPACE to return to the menu.
The goal is to squish a stack of boxes(5+) against a wall until all the boxes are gone.

you can make custom maps using .txt files.
# is a wall
0 is a box
@ is the spawn point
. is a movable space
b is a blank space(all rows must have same size)

//save files and time coming soon
